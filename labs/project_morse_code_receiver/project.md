## Project objectives

As main objective of our project  we see learning how direct hardware programming works.

In this exact project  is our objective to complete "Morse code reciever" an we decided to  devide this into smaller objectives:
	1. Create character map for seven segment display that will work for all  characters and numbers.

	2. Create source file for our project that would insert buttons entries as zeroes and ones(. = 0 , _ = 1) and shift them into memory.
	3. Create TOP source file that would use our translate program and our inserting program and with help from seven segment driver and clock enabling program, to show recieved character.
